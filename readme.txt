EpicEditor for WordPress enables a Markdown text editor to be used along side WordPress' default text editor.

== Description ==

EpicEditor is a Markdown text editor. This plugin adds to the default WYSIWYG editor with EpicEditor for some awesome Markdown goodness. When activated, you'll see a new tab on your text editor for writing your posts and pages in Markdown.

## Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Markdown was created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/). You can [read more about it](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or his [full documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) on the syntax &mdash; where the above documentation was originally pulled from. All credit for Markdown and these documentations goes to him.

## EpicEditor

[EpicEditor](http://epiceditor.com/) is an embeddable JavaScript [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor with split fullscreen editing, live previewing, automatic draft saving, offline support, and more. For developers, it offers a robust API, can be easily themed, and allows you to swap out the bundled Markdown parser with anything you throw at it.

EpicEditor relies on [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to parse markdown and is brought to you in part by [Oscar Godson](http://twitter.com/oscargodson) and [John Donahue](http://twitter.com/johnmdonahue). Special thanks to [Adam Bickford](http://twitter.com/adam_bickford) for the bug fixes and being the QA for pull requests. Lastly, huge thanks to [Sebastian Nitu](http://twitter.com/sebnitu) for the amazing logo and doc styles.

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
